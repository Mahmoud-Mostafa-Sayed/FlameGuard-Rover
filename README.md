# FlameGuard-Rover

🚗🔥 Introducing FlameGuard Rover – Our Intelligent Fire-Responsive Line-Following Robot! 🔥🚗

After weeks of planning, coding, prototyping, and testing, our team is thrilled to unveil FlameGuard Rover – a smart robotic car built from the ground up using the STM32 (Blue Pill) microcontroller and pure ARM Assembly! 💻⚙️

But this isn’t just any robot. Here’s what makes FlameGuard Rover unique:

🧠 Autonomous Line Tracking using IR sensors
📏 Obstacle Detection with Ultrasonic Sensor
📡 Bluetooth Remote Control for real-time direction + speed
🔥 Flame Detection System that automatically reacts to fire
🚿 Servo-controlled Water Pump that extinguishes the flame
🎚️ Speed Control via PWM
😄😠 LCD with Emotional Feedback (Smiley & Angry Faces)
⏱️ Efficient Delay & Timeout Mechanisms for accuracy
🧩 And yes — we designed and built the chassis ourselves from scratch! 🛠️✨

From embedded logic to hardware integration, FlameGuard Rover is a full-stack mechatronics achievement we're proud of! 🚀💪
